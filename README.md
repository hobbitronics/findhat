# findhat
a simple terminal game where you are a'*' in an array field. You must navigate using keys to get to your hat represented by '^' while avoiding holes 'O'.
If you fall in a hole or go out of bounds you lose the round.
You can choose the size of the field when the game initializes by specifying width and height of the array.
This game uses prompt-sync so if you have not installed the game may not run.
